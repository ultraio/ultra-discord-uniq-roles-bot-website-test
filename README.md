# Client Page

This utilizes Vite to create a single page application that utilizes Vue.

## Commands

From the root directory of this monorepo; run any of the following commands.

### Vue Development Server

Spins up a localhost server to perform development. This spins up a `Vite` server on port `3000` (usually) and allows you to make changes and view them in your browser.

```
npm run vue-dev
```

### Build

Builds the client-side into a single page application, and pushes it to the `dist` folder.

```
npm run build
```

## Folder Structure

This is a traditional Vite + Vue folder structure with TypeScript.

Everything is inside of the `src` directory.
